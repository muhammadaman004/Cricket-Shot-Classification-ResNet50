# Cricket Shot Classification using ResNet50
## Overview
This project focuses on classifying different types of cricket shots using deep learning techniques. A ResNet50 model is employed to classify four types of cricket shots: drive, leg glance-flick, sweep, and pull shot. The project is implemented using PyTorch and aims to provide accurate predictions for cricket shot images.
## Data Source
